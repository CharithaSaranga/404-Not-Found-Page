# 404 Not Found Page

This repository contains the code for a simple 404 Not Found page. It is a static HTML page that displays a friendly error message when a user tries to access a page that doesn't exist or is temporarily unavailable. The page features a creative design with a scarecrow image and a clear message explaining the error to the user.

## Customization

You can customize the page by modifying the HTML and CSS files. Here are a few ways to make changes:

- Update the error message: You can change the text in the `<h1 class="error-title">` and `<p class="error-explain">` elements to display a different error message.
- Modify the button text: You can change the text inside the `<span class="back-btn-text">` element to customize the button text.
- Change the images: Replace the `Scarecrow.png` image in the `img` folder with your own image to personalize the page.

Feel free to experiment and make the page your own!
